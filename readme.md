# having fun creating an OBS overlay

```
npm ci
npm run build
npm run start
```

- Overlay: http://localhost:8080/
- Admin: http://localhost:8080/admin.html

## http2

[mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) is awesome, to use http2 generate certs for localhost and place them on root.

if localhost.pem and localhost-key.pem exists, then http2 and https is enabled.
